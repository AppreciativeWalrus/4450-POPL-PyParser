This is my (Isabel Layand's) final project for Principles Of Programming Languages

This was done alone, the team is just Isabel Layland

The repo is here in case you're lose somehow: https://github.com/AppreciativeWalrus/4450-POPL-PyParser


----




This parser runs using Python3.

This python parser requires the antlr denter library from https://github.com/yshavit/antlr-denter

It also requires the python 3 libraries for ANTLR avalable at https://pypi.org/project/antlr4-python3-runtime/


----

HOW TO USE:

Invoke AGONYMain.py with an argument of a file name.

for example: "py AGONYMain.py WORDS.txt"

This file should contain the code/text to be parsed

That's it.

It should output errors if it didn't parse, or it will output the full parse tree. It isn't very readable, but that doesnt matter too much.


----

Supported aspects of python: (just the requirements of the assignment)

• Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %,) 

• Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=) 

• Variable definitions 

• if/else blocks 

• Conditional statements (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, and, or, not) 

• while and for Loops 

• Support for comments

• Support for function implementations 

• Function calls

This will also serve as the text file rating my group members:

Isabel Layland 100/100

She did very well! No one else contributed!

There are no other group members.
